Nokia N950 OneClickFlashers

Introduction

   Use the Nokia N950 OneClickFlashers to update a Nokia N950 phone to the
   an appropriate firmware version with a computer running Microsoft
   Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or Linux. This may be necessary in order to
   update a device with older software image to the newer software, or to
   return a malfunctioning device to a known state.

   This page provides OneClickFlashers for firmware versions 1.1 and 1.2.

   Note: The flashers provide no means for downgrading the firmware! So
   once you've installed a more recent version, there is no way to return
   to an older version.

   Note: These tools are to be used only with the N950 device, do not
   attempt to update your N9 device with them!

   This [2]blog post in the N9 Developer blog provides information about
   the naming scheme used for the firmware.

   This page offers both the Global and Chinese variants of the firmware.

How to check a device's firmware version and variant

   To check the firmware version on your device: open Settings and tap
   About Product.

Short instructions

    1. Download the appropriate OneClickFlasher.
    2. Power off your device by holding down the power key for at least 8
       seconds.
    3. Start the OneClickFlasher (In Windows, use Windows Explorer; in
       Linux and Mac OS X, use a terminal window).
    4. Follow the instructions on the screen and wait until the device is
       flashed.

Detailed instructions

   Note: Do not connect the device to the computer until the instructions
   on the screen tell you to.

Windows

    1. Double-click the downloaded file in Windows Explorer.
    2. Click "Yes".
    3. In Terms & Conditions, click Accept.
    4. Wait until the following text is displayed:

                Suitable USB interface (bootloader/phonet) not found,
                waiting...

    5. Ensure that the device is switched off by holding the power key
       down 8+ seconds, then connect the device and the computer with the
       USB cable.
    6. When you connect the cable, the device displays the text "NOKIA"
       and switches on automatically.
    7. If an "Installing Driver Device Software" notification appears on
       the lower right corner of your PC screen, click the notification.
       Immediately click "Skip" for obtaining driver software from Windows
       Update.

                Note: You must click the link during the time that the USB
                icon is displayed on the Harmattan device. If you click
                the link too late, the device starts to boot and you must
                start the flashing procedure again from step 4. In that
                case, you may need to repeat the procedure 1-2 times
                before the flashing is successful.

    8. Wait until the required drivers are installed and the device is
       flashed. This may take up to 30 minutes.

Troubleshooting

   Occasionally the OneClickFlasher does not immediately recognise a
   device when it is plugged in. Unplug the device, power it off by
   holding down the power key for 8+ seconds (even if the screen is black,
   and the device appears to be powered off) and plug it in again.

   Occasionally the flasher fails to run to completion. Try executing the
   OneClickFlasher again.

   However, if the flasher persistently fails during the emmc-erasing
   stage, contact the Nokia organization you received this phone from for
   further instructions.

   In Windows, the USB autodetection and driver installation may cause
   problems. You may need to connect, wait for drivers, disconnect cable,
   power off the device, and reconnect a few times. If plugging and
   unplugging the cable does not solve the problem and the flasher still
   waits for suitable USB interface, re-install the USB drivers:
    1. Stop the OneClickFlasher.
    2. Click "Control Panel" -> "Programs and Features" and uninstall
       "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" from the list.
    3. Run OneClickFlasher again, and it will re-install the drivers.

   In Windows environment the Program Compatibility Assistant might appear
   sometimes after flashing is finished. Click "This program installed
   correctly" to close the Program Compatibility Assistant.

   In Mac OS X environment executing the flasher occasionally causes
   keyboard and touchpad unresponsiveness on certain MacBook Pro laptops.
   Even if the computer can no longer be interacted with, the device
   flashing finishes successfully. Please ensure that you have saved the
   contents of all open files before running the OneClickFlasher.
